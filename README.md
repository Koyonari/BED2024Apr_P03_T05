## Introduction
We are Team 5 from P03, taking the BED Module from Software Engineering Specialisation under Information Technology (N54). This repository is for our assignment project, NutriAid.

NutriAid is a web application designed to bridge the gap between underprivileged individuals and volunteers willing to provide food aid.

## Objective
The platform facilitates efficient and organised distribution of food resources by allowing users to post their requests for help in a forum-like manner, which volunteers are able to accept and fulfil. This will be achieved through three main goals:
1. Provide a way to allow underprivileged individuals to post requests asking for food.
2. Facilitate volunteers in finding and fulfilling these requests.
3. Ensure efficient and organized distribution of food resources.
